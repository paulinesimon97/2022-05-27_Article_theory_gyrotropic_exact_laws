**Abstract:**  We derive an exact law for compressible pressure-anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. For a gyrotropic pressure tensor, we study the double-adiabatic case and show the presence of new flux and source terms in the exact law, reminiscent of the plasma instability conditions due to pressure anisotropy. The Hall term is shown to bring ion-scale corrections to the exact law without affecting explicitly the pressure terms. In the pressure isotropy limit we recover all known results obtained for isothermal and polytropic closures. The incompressible limit of the gyrotropic system leads to a generalization of the Politano and Pouquet's law where a new incompressible source term is revealed and reflects exchanges of the magnetic and kinetic energies with the no-longer-conserved internal energy. We highlight the possibilities offered by the new laws to investigate potential links between turbulence cascade and instabilities widely observed in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.
